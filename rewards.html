        <h4>The rewards of being a Gladiator</h4>
        <p>You see speech is useful in all parts of life, and being able to articulate an idea is extremely useful
            In school, at home, and around other people (friends, strangers, etc.) being able to speak well allows your ideas to stick out and be heard</p>

        <h4>Rhetorical Tools/Emulating the fighting style of a gladiator</h4>
        <p>A Gladiator requires special words to hook in their audience</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ø Tool one: evocative words that the audience can remember
            </li>
            <li>
                Ø Tool two: intensifiers that allow the audience to understand the importance of their message
            </li>face
            <li>
                Ø Tool three: hedging, or how to give a speech without being wrong. It is like adding a realm of 
                vagueness to your speech so that audiences would know you weren’t lying/being overly confident. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Ø Tool four: tone (one of the most important). Tone, like the sharpness of a fighting weapon, 
                allows a speaker to lure their audience in, so that they can more effectively deliver this message.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ø Posture and Body Language (A Gladiator’s Fighting Stance)
            </li>
            <li>
                Ø Tool one: Look and be confident. Go over your speech multiple times so that by the time you give your speech, 
                you are completely confident in your own material. You should be able to go over your speech at the drop of a hat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ø Tool two: Good posture. The way you stand is a big part of this-it communicates your own confidence and 
                also allows you to build an environment where you are comfortable. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ø Tool three: Be prepared. Successful speeches have usually been rehearsed multiple times before they are performed; 
                you should treat your own speeches this way. Come with everything prepared.
